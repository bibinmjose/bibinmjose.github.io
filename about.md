      Hi, this is Bibin Jose, a Data-Scientist working on multiple enterprise solutions focused on timeseries forecasting and computer vision. I started this blog to aggregate interesting stuff I pick up on the way. Although I try to keep this website up-to-date, my schedule seldom permits frequent updates. Hope you could find something useful here. I am also grateful to <a href="https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme">Tian Qi</a> for this theme. Tired of wordpress and monthly charges, I am currently migrating all things I have written across multiple platforms across last few years to this site. I have to admit, <b>I<span style='font-size:15px;'> &#128150;</span> Jekyll</b> that I keep learning something new about it whenever I update.
      </p>
