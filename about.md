      I started this blog as an aggregator of inetresting stuff I pick on my work in data science and computing. This helps me keep track of what I've learnt although time seldom permits me to update frequently. Hope you could find something useful here. I am also grateful to <a href="https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme">Tian Qi</a> for this jekyll theme.
